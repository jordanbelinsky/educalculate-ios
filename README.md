# Educ[alcul]ate for iOS
Based upon my Python Application Edu[calcul]ate, this application is a complete rewrite from the ground up. Using Swift to code for iOS devices, this app was created to provide Edu[calcul]ate's functions in a much nicer, easy-to-use UI experience.

## Features:
- Calculate weighted averages for tests or examinations
- Determine final mark based on predicted exam score
- Determine required exam score for desired final mark
- Track enrolled classes
- Document each returned assignment/examination, and its corresponding mark
