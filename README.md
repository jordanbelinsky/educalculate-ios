<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

After building the original Educ(alcul)ate as a quick and convenient way to compute weighted averages for my assessments, I decided to build it out into a fully functional native iOS app, and expand the feature set. While the original version was only weighted average calculations, the refined version includes the following features:

* Weighted average calculator
* Final exam mark calculator
* Class tracking
* Assessment tracking

All of these features combine to create a more feature-complete app for students to track their success at any level of education. Versions were beta tested amongst my peers, and upon its final release to the App Store, it was featured in the York Region District School Board (YRDSB) Guidance Toolbook, in guidance offices across the district.

As of 2020, the app is no longer available on the App Store, but can be built for personal use using Xcode.
